# How to write a bug report

If you’re experiencing a technical issue or a bug, make sure to report an issue based on the below information to increase the chances of getting a timely and accurate response from PTC employees or the community.

**Note:** PTC employees can only provide developer support for recent Vuforia Engine versions. Version 9, 8, or lower are deprecated and might not receive any answer.

- **Vuforia Engine version**
- **Platform version** (Unity, Android Studio, Xcode, Visual Studio)
- **Device information** (model Name, OS, version)

You should also highlight what the observed problem is, what your expected result is and the reproducible steps. You should be able to reproduce your issue with the [Core Samples](https://developer.vuforia.com/downloads/samples) of Vuforia Engine.

- **Observed problem**
- **Expected result**
- **Reproducible steps**

Without highlighting the *observed problem* and *expected result*, it is difficult to understand what the issue might be. The *reproducible steps* are highly valuable as they’re used to replicate the issue and later verify the solution.

Depending on your problem (error, visual glitch, etc.) these details are very important as well:

- **Device log files**
- **Affected datasets**
- **Videos showing the observed issue** (e.g. visual artifact screen recording, [Session Recording](https://library.vuforia.com/platform-support/recording-and-playback), etc.)
- **Other observations and notes**

When you provide these valuable details, your specific issue can be assessed as best as possible.

**Note:** Without all details you might get **no responses** to your issues.

# How to share feedback

- Check if your feedback fits the selected category and if there's already submitted feedback from other developers before creating your own.
- Be **clear** with your feedback, provide use-cases and solutions to the improvements you are posing. Feedback without actionable details may be removed without comment.
- Instead of creating similar feedback posts, try to upvote or comment on existing feedback.
- Make sure to share your post with others to gain more support!
- Titles that are unclear or unnecessarily vulgar may be reworded to better reflect the request for ease of discovery.
- **Note:** Feedback is not a guarantee that we will take action on an idea. We will try our best to communicate why an idea may not work, but may not always be able to share that information.

**Appeals or commentary on suspension decisions, support requests, suggestions disparaging others, and non-constructive feedback can be closed without comment.**
