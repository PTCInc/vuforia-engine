# Contribution Guidelines

## Where to contribute

Please use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/PTCInc/vuforia-engine/issues) to report bugs, share feedback, or request new features and device support.

## How to write a bug report

If you’re experiencing a technical issue or a bug, please submit an issue with the information below to increase the chances of getting a timely and accurate response from PTC staff or the community.

- **Vuforia Engine version**
- **Developer Platform version** (Unity, Android Studio, Xcode, Visual Studio)
- **Device information** (Model name, OS, version, etc.)

**Note:** PTC staff can only provide developer support for recent Vuforia Engine versions. Version 9, 8, or lower are deprecated and might not receive any answer.

You should also highlight what the observed problem is, what your expected result is, and the reproducible steps. You should be able to reproduce your issue with the [Core Samples](https://developer.vuforia.com/downloads/samples) of Vuforia Engine.

- **Observed problem**
- **Expected result**
- **Reproducible steps**

Without highlighting the *observed problem* and *expected result*, it is difficult to understand what the issue might be. The *reproducible steps* are highly valuable as they’re used to replicate the issue and later verify the solution.

Depending on your problem (error, visual glitch, etc.) these details are also very important:

- **Device log files**
- **Affected datasets**
- **Videos showing the observed issue** (e.g. visual artifact screen recording, [Session Recording](https://library.vuforia.com/platform-support/recording-and-playback), etc.)
- **Other observations and notes**

Providing these valuable details, will help us to best assess your specific issue.

**Note:** Without sufficient details you might get **no responses** for your issues.

## How to share feedback

- Check if your feedback fits the selected category and if there's already submitted feedback from other developers before creating your own.
- Be **clear** with your feedback, provide use-cases and solutions to the improvements you are posing. Feedback without actionable details may be removed without comment.
- Instead of creating similar feedback posts, try to upvote or comment on existing feedback.
- Make sure to share your post with others to gain more support!
- Titles that are unclear or unnecessarily vulgar may be reworded to better reflect the request for ease of discovery.

**Note:** Feedback and discussions from the PTC staff are not a guarantee that we will act on feedback. We will do our best to communicate why an idea may or may not work, but cannot always be able to share that information.

**Appeals or commentary on suspension decisions, support requests, suggestions disparaging others, and non-constructive feedback will be closed without comment.**
