## How to write a bug report

If youâ€™re experiencing a technical issue or a bug, you can submit a case using the "Bug Report" issue template.

Please submit an issue using the information below to increase your chances of getting a timely and accurate response from PTC staff or the community.

- **Vuforia Engine version**
- **Developer Platform version** (Unity, Android Studio, Xcode, Visual Studio)
- **Device information** (Model name, OS, version, etc.)

**Note:** PTC staff can only provide developer support for the most recent versions of the Vuforia Engine. Versions 9 or earlier are deprecated and may not receive a response.

When reporting an issue, please clearly describe the problem, including the expected outcome and the steps taken to reproduce it. To help troubleshoot the issue, please reproduce it using the [Core Samples](https://developer.vuforia.com/downloads/samples) of Vuforia Engine, as this will aid in identifying the cause of the issue. Please use our [troubleshooting guide](https://developer.vuforia.com/library/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-your-app) to narrow down plausible causes of your problem.

- **Observed problem**
- **Expected outcome**
- **Reproducible steps**

It is essential to clearly describe the *observed problem* and *expected outcome* when reporting an issue, as this allows for a better understanding of the problem at hand. Additionally, providing *reproducible steps* is crucial, as it allows for the replication of the issue and verification of the solution.

When reporting an issue, it is also essential to provide additional details depending on the nature of the problem, such as error messages, visual glitches, etc.

These valuable details will help us assess your specific issue better:

- **Device log files**
- **Affected datasets**
- **Videos showing the observed issue** (e.g., visual artifact screen recording, target issue recording, etc.)
- **Session Recording file** (Through the [SessionRecorder API](https://developer.vuforia.com/library/platform-support/recording-and-playback))
- **Other observations and notes**

Please use OneDrive to share larger files and projects by sharing a link in the issue report. For sensitive data, you can send the OneDrive link to vuforia-feedback@ptc.com with the issue-case number.

## How to share feedback

If you want to share feedback related to the SDK, you can submit an issue via the various feedback issue templates mentioned above.

Please consider the following information when sharing feedback to increase the chances of getting a timely and accurate response from PTC staff or the community:

- Before submitting your feedback, verify that it aligns with the appropriate category and that similar feedback has not already been submitted by other developers.
- Clearly state your feedback, providing specific use cases and solutions for your suggested improvements. Feedback without actionable details may be removed without comment.
- Consider upvoting or commenting on existing feedback that aligns with your request.
- Issue titles that are unclear or contain inappropriate language may be reworded for better visibility and discoverability.
- Share your feedback with others to increase support and improve the chances of implementation.

**Note:** Submitting feedback or requests does not guarantee they will be acted upon. We will make every effort to provide an explanation for why an idea may or may not be feasible, but there may be instances where we are unable to share that kind of information.
